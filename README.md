# Etherlords II Roguelike Custom Map
This is an old project of mine, but I've found the files recently and decided to give it proper justice. Even though Etherlords II is an old game, there's a huge potential to make custom maps that can give long hours of engagement and a very unique experience. I've made this map public for those who want to play custom maps but also as an example of the possibilities for those who want to make something similar.

## About the Map
The map is very small, but it uses a system seen in roguelike (more specifically roguelite) games where levels are generated and populated dynamically. This means that each time the map is cleared, a new "rotation" starts where stronger enemies, different resources, shrines and shops appear and a different path may open up for exploration. I've also made sure to make the map as balanced as possible despite the huge factor of chances. The only thing that's missing is the story, so don't expect much from that part. There are still a few things that could be added or improved, though I'm currently happy with the map as it is.

The following is in the map's description:
> An attempt at creating a map with procedural map generation and random loot system. Every game is different, allowing you to try different character builds against different types of enemies and giving you the chance to try spells and combinations you never thought would be useful. The further you go, the harder it gets, but there are also more and better rewards. Good luck and have fun!

## Features
- Unique main hero: random starting spells and appearance
- Changing background music, to less likely get bored of it
- Randomly scattered resources and enemies
- Random boss mob at the end of each rotation
- Randomly selected shrines and artefacts while exploring and after bosses
- Artefact recharger every few rotations to encourage artefact usage but still make them situational
- One of many possible shops before each boss, focused around a theme, like rats or healing
- Terrain objects that may open up or lock areas
- No faction limitations, allowing you to try unique spell combinations
- Progressively stronger enemies and better loot from them
- No fixed loot from enemies, they always drop something different
- And of course, most of these are determined before each rotation or upon starting a new game, making sure that every attempt is unique

## Installation
First, clone the repository or [click here](https://github.com/Bonesnake/etherlordsII-roguelike-map/archive/master.zip) to download the latest snapshot.

Then, locate the root directory of Etherlords II and copy or extract the **Maps** folder and its content there. There should be 7 files with *roguelike* prefix inside *Etherlords II\Maps\Custom* if done correctly. The *README.md* and *.gitattributes* files are not needed.

To start the map, launch the game, go into *Single* -> *Mission* -> *New*, select the map and the difficulty, then hit the play button.\
***Note: if you have saves from an earlier version, you will most likely not be able to load them in the newest version.***

*Sadly, I cannot provide links for the map editor because those I've found on the internet require a CD instalment. The GOG version of the game has the map editor, only the Steam version lacks it, but if you manage to get your hands on the editor, you can use it with the Steam version too.*

[Catch the Thief](https://github.com/aloeser/Etherlords2Map) *- A high quality, challenging custom map for Etherlords II. It has some unique features and offers many hours of playtime. If you want to play something similar to the main campaign, I strongly recommend it!*
